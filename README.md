A Learning Management System (LMS) API built using microservices architecture and gRPC.

## Background Problem
Traditional learning management systems (LMS) often struggle with scalability, real-time interaction, and integration with modern tools. As education shifts to remote and hybrid models, existing LMS platforms are unable to handle large user bases, provide timely updates, or seamlessly integrate tools like video conferencing and real-time notifications.
Smartcy solves these challenges by using microservices architecture and gRPC, ensuring scalability, real-time updates, and easy integration with external services.
